## Description
This tool is to help people determine if their acoustic deterrent devices are approved (per NMFS guidelines) for use to deter specific groups of marine mammals. The tool takes device specifications and calculates the 100-m isopleth distances. The user can download a certificate if their device is approved, which lists their name, device, device specifications, and the expiration date.
