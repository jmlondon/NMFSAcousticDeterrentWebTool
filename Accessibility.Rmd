### Introduction
Online tools should be accessible to the broadest possible audience. I have been thinking about ways to measure how usable software is, and how easily it can be used and interpreted by a broad user group. As far as I know, there are not a lot of packages or tools that enhance accessibility for Shiny apps, although as discussed below there are some features that are built into the defaults, that improve usability. 

### WCAG guidelines
The Web Accessibility Initiative publishes Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the requirements and techniques for meeting each of those guidelines. I went through those guidelines and checked which ones the current version of this Shiny app complies with, and where it could be improved/how feasible it would be to improve. 

[WCAG 2]((https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) gives a technical standard for developers to make content as accessible as possible for a wide audience. 

WCAG describe three primary principles:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable

The general categories under each of these are:

1. Perceivable

	1.1 Text alternatives
	
	1.2 Time-based media
	
	1.3 Adaptable
	
	1.4 Distinguishable
	
2. Operable
	2.1 Keyboard Accessible
	2.2 Enough Time
	2.3 Seizures and Physical Reacitons
	2.4 Navigable
	2.5 Input Modalities
3. Understandable
	3.1 Readable
	3.2 Predictable
	3.3 Input Assistance
4. Robust
	4.1 Compatible
